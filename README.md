# Experimentation Table Solvers for newer ct versions.
### This is a completely new module for those of you who still use ct for Experiments but couldn't use the old module since it requires an older version of ct.
### `/exp` to open the Settings.
### The most updated version can be found here: https://github.com/Cakend123/ExperimentationTableV2.
##### DM Marvinschs#2416 if you find any bugs or have features that you would like implemented. To make my life better: After something went wrong type: `/ct console js` and also Dm me the Error Message (ofc. you can blurr out your directories if you want)
